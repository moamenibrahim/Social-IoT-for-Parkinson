# UBISS18 (Park-Treat)

Application to encourage parkinson’s patients to take their medication through an interesting gaming platform

## About Park-Treat

Park-Treat is an android mobile application to Track medical intake of Parkinson’s patients using Smartphones and Myo Band

## Challenge and our solution

The most frequently prescribed medicine for Parkinson’s disease, L-Dopa, is found to be addictive -- psychologically and physiologically. How to find if the patient needs the medicine to amiliorate his/her symptoms or to “feel good”? 

## Requirements

The patient is required to wear the Myo band and draw some simple shapes on the smartphone screen within our app.
